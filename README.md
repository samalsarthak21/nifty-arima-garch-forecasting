# NIFTY Forecasting with ARIMA + GARCH

**Goal:** Build a forecasting and volatility modelling dashboard for NIFTY 50 using ARIMA for returns and GARCH(1,1) for conditional volatility.

## Project Status

- [x] Project structure
- [ ] Data download & cleaning
- [ ] ARIMA modelling
- [ ] GARCH volatility modelling
- [ ] Dashboard & plots
- [ ] Evaluation & documentation

## Tech stack

- Python (pandas, numpy, statsmodels, arch, matplotlib/plotly)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Streamlit (for final dashboard)

## Planned features

- ADF stationarity test on NIFTY returns
- ARIMA model for mean dynamics
- GARCH(1,1) for volatility clustering
- 30-day forecast for price & volatility
- RMSE comparison vs naive forecast
- Clear plots and a simple dashboard
